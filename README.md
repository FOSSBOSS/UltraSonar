Thought this might be a fun project. The polar conversion is probably overhead, 
if I was planning to plot the coordinates on a rotational field of view, 
the way a traditional sonar is displayed, this would be unneccisary. 
At the time I wrote this, I was thinkgin about it drawing in a box, 
Program window, so thats how I wrote it.
